Title: GAN-Based Semantic Segmentation Enhancement for Complex Scenes in ADE20K
                                                                          -----COMP9444 24 T3 Project


This project aims to enhance the accuracy and detail of semantic segmentation for complex scenes in the ADE20K
dataset using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By leveraging the capabilities of GANs, the project will focus
on refining segmentation maps to capture fine-grained details and improve overall segmentation performance. The
approach involves training a GAN-based model that learns to generate high-quality segmentation masks from input
images, effectively addressing challenges such as occlusions, varying lighting conditions, and diverse scene
compositions. The enhanced segmentation maps produced by the GAN will be evaluated against standard
benchmarks to demonstrate improvements over traditional segmentation methods.
